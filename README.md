## Welcome to Swarm City


We are on the leading edge of a new technological era, an era that is disrupting the economics of human interactions. Swarm City is developing a truly Decentralized App (dapp), enabled by the SWT token, running on the Ethereum blockchain to interconnect world industries and enable open peer to peer exchanges.

It is our mission to provide an open marketplace of services, currency tokens and encrypted communication tools to offer unfettered access between buyers and sellers worldwide and in your community.

## What is Swarm City?

Swarm City is developing a dapp that will allow any p2p service. Anybody will be able to run and use any service on that platform. The first service that is in development is a needaride service (known as uberlike). The next service maintained by the core team will be a swarmbnb (known as airbnbnlike).
