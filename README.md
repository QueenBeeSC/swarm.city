## What is Swarm City?

Swarm City is developing a decentralized app (DApp) that will allow any peer-to-peer (P2P) service exchange, meaning no middleman, no central servers, and no unnecessary restrictions. Anybody will be able to exchange Swarm City Tokens (SWT), a cryptocurrency minted to exchange between users, obtaining any service available on the platform in their area. The first service to be developed is a #needaride service, aka ridesharing. The next service will most likely be #SwarmBnb, aka airbnb, and many other hashtags will follow.
